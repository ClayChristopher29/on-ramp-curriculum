# Pre Work Course

Congratulations! You've begun your journey into web development. This course is designed to prepare you for the NewForce curriculum so that you can hit the ground running on day one of class.

This course will be your introduction to the three primary languages of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Course Objectives
First and foremost, this course is designed to give _you_ a sense of what NewForce will be like before you quit your job and commit to a six-month, full-time learning experience.

 Keep the following questions in mind as you go through the course:
1. Do I enjoy coding? Am I curious about and motivated to solve these kinds of problems?
1. Does this style of learning work for me?

This course will also give you a foundational understanding for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This foundation is essential for you to keep pace with the NewForce curriculum.

1. Navigate your computer through your terminal
