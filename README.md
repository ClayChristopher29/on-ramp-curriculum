# Pre Work Course

Congratulations! You've begun your journey into web development. This course is designed to prepare you for the NewForce curriculum so that you can hit the ground running on day one of class.

## Course Objectives

This course will be your introduction to the primary languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This foundation is essential for you to keep pace with the NewForce curriculum.

This course is also designed to give _you_ a sense of what NewForce will be like before you quit your job and commit to a six-month, full-time learning experience.

 Keep the following questions in mind as you go through the course:
1. Do I enjoy coding? Am I curious about and motivated to solve these kinds of problems?
1. Does this style of learning work for me? Can I live without understanding 100% of the things 100% of the time? 

If the answer to any of these questions is anything other than a solid yes, please reach out to one of your instructors. NewForce is not hte only path to becoming a developer and we're more than happy to help you figure out if this is the right one for you.
