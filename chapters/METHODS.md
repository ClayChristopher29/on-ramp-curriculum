# Methods in Objects

Back when we were first learning about JavaScript, we learned that objects are a great way to store information about people and things. Here's an object representing a dog:

```js
var hoagieObject = {
  name: "Hoagie",
  color: "Gray",
  type: "Dog",
  favoriteThings: ["human laps", "floofy blankets", "dog parks"]
}
```
We've given our `hoagieObject` some data, but what if we want Hoagie to be able to *do* things? We give objects behaviors with methods. Methods are just functions stored inside of objects.

```js
var hoagieObject = {
  name: "Hoagie",
  color: "Gray",
  type: "Dog",
  favoriteThings: ["human laps", "floofy blankets", "dog parks"],
  bark: function(){
    console.log("woof!");
  },
  eat: function(food){
    console.log(`${this.name} eats ${food}.`);
  }
}

hoagieObject.bark(); // "woof!"
hoagieObject.eat("dog food"); // "Hoagie eats dog food." 
```

Let's look at another example:
```js

// Let's declare an object to represent our friend Emily
var emilyObject = {
  firstName: "Emily",
  lastName: "Lemmon",
  fullName: function(){
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
  greetSomeone: function(personsName){
    console.log(`Hi, ${personsName}, I'm ${this.fullName()}.`);
  }
}

// And another one to represent our other friend Jisie
var jisieObject = {
  firstName: "Jisie",
  lastName: "David",
  fullName: function(){
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
  greetSomeone: function(personsName){
    console.log(`Hi, ${personsName}, I'm ${this.fullName()}.`);
  }
}

// Now we can have them say hi to each other!

emilyObject.greetSomeone(jisieObject.firstName);
// Expected output: "Hi, Jisie, I'm Emily Lemmon.

jisieObject.greetSomeone(emilyObject.firstName);
// Expected output: "Hi, Emily, I'm Jisie David.

```

# Practice

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/on-boarding/exercises/javascript/methods && cd $_
touch index.html script.js
```
Be sure to add boilerplate HTML to your `index.html` file and link it to `script.js`.

#### Pet Store
Using the above example, create three new objects to represent different pets in a pet store. Each pet should have:
- A name
- A type (bird, lizard, cat, etc)
- An array that contains their favorite things
- A method to make a sound
- A method called `eat` that accepts one paramter called `foodName` and returns a string that looks something like the one in the dog example from up top.

#### Address Book
1. Create an object that represents your contact information. Use the code below as an example:
```js
var jordanContactInfo = {
  cell: "(999) 999-9999",
  email: "jordan.castelloe@gmail.com",
  address: "123 Sesame St"
}
```
1. Go ahead and create two more objects that represent two of your friends' contact information.
1. Now give each of your three objects a method called `callCellPhone`. It should accept a parameter of `phoneNumber`. For example, my object would now look like this: 
```js
var jordanContactInfo = {
  cell: "(999) 999-9999",
  email: "jordan.castelloe@gmail.com",
  address: "123 Sesame St",
  callCellPhone: function(phoneNumber){
    console.log(`Now calling ${phoneNumber}`);
  }
}
```
1. Give each object a couple more methods: 
  - A method called `sendEmail` (which should accept a parameter of `emailAddress`)
  - A method called `sendMail` (which should accept a parameter called `mailingAddress`)
  - Don't worry to much about what the methods do- just logging something to the console is fine.
2. Now invoke some of the methods. Have one friend "call" another friend's cell phone number, etc.

#### Calculator
Copy and paste the following code into your JavaScript file:
```js
var calculator = {
  add: function(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

var sum = calculator.add(2, 2);
console.log(sum); // Expected output: 4
```
- Add methods to the `calculator` object for subtraction, division, and multiplication.
- Call each method twice with different parameters.

#### Shopping Cart

Copy and paste the following code into your JavaScript file: 
```js
var shoppingCart = {
  items: [
    {
      name: "Bananas",
      totalPrice: 2.75
    },
    {
      name: "English Muffins",
      totalPrice: 3.99
    },
    {
      name: "Peanut Butter",
      totalPrice: 2.99
    }
  ],
  calculateTotal: function(){
    // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    // Write a method that loops through the items array and adds up the totalPrice of each item. This method should return a total.
  }
}
```

Fill in the `calcualteTotal` method to add up a grand total for all the items in the shopping cart and return it. (Hint: you can access the `items` array from inside the object with `this.items`.)
